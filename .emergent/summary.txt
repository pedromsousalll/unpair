The previous AI engineer meticulously developed the KICKS application, starting from an Expo (React Native) template with Firebase integration. Initial efforts focused on fixing critical setup issues like  pathing, Firebase environment variables, and platform-specific persistence. Key features like Google Sign-In, dark mode, messaging, and authentication guards were implemented.

A significant portion of the work involved iterative UI/UX redesigns based on user feedback, transitioning from a playful skateboard aesthetic to a graffiti street-art style, and finally settling on a sophisticated streetwear theme with dark grey backgrounds, golden highlights, rounded components, and Oswald font. This required creating a reusable component library and extensive modifications across all screens.

Challenges included persistent animation lag, Google Sign-In domain errors, accidental deletion of core screens (, , ) requiring recreation, and numerous UI refinements (e.g., dropdown styling, form centering, notification prompts,  imports). The engineer consistently debugged and addressed these issues, restarting the frontend frequently to apply changes. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively working on adjusting the welcome screen GIF size and troubleshooting Firebase Google authentication.

The goal is to build the KICKS sneaker marketplace using Expo (React Native) for cross-platform mobile/web, Firebase for authentication (email/password, Google Sign-In) and Firestore for data (, , , , , ). The app features product listings, selling, searching, chat, user profiles, and real-time notifications. Initial styling used Gluestack-UI.

The UI/UX underwent major iterations:
1.  **Phase 1 (Skateboarding theme):** Dark mode, profile photo, settings page, messaging, mandatory authentication (except Home), homepage grid, skateboarding slang.
2.  **Phase 2 (Playful Skateboard):** Bright colors (mint green, pastel pink, yellow accents), flat design, soft rounded corners, modern typography.
3.  **Phase 3 (Graffiti Street-Art):** Neon spray colors on dark concrete/brick, bold typography, specific designs for Login/Signup, Home, Add Listing, Search, Chat, Profile/Settings.
4.  **Phase 4 (Sophisticated Streetwear - Current):** Dark grey background (#373734) with texture, #f1b311 for highlights, rounded buttons, Oswald font (Bold 700 for titles, Light 300 for text). All forms vertically centered.

Recent additions include a new welcome screen with animation and specific quote, dynamic Brand and Size (EU/US toggle) pickers for forms, image upload functionality, loading states, success messages, and notification permission requests for user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing three user-reported issues:
1.  **Requesting kick form (search screen):** The success message for finding a match was not showing consistently, especially if notification permissions were declined. The engineer was in the process of fixing  to ensure the success message always appears.
2.  **Welcome screen GIF:** The user requested the GIF animation on the welcome screen to be made bigger. The engineer had just completed modifications to  and stated the next step was to enlarge the welcome GIF.
3.  **Google authentication:** The user reported that Google authentication was not working, citing a Firebase error. This issue was acknowledged by the engineer as an immediate task to fix after the current UI refinements.

The trajectory concludes with the engineer having edited  to fix the notification success message logic and then starting on the welcome GIF size adjustment.
